# 2nd-Year-Prototype-Website

Designed as part of 2nd year in BSc. Although its not aesthetically pleasing it does hold all the functionality.

Login system with student/admin levels. Ability to alter personal details for the student. Admin can login and promote student, remove, add or edit details. Connects via a php query to external SQL datababase (schema etc removed for security)

Vanilla website (without login system) went live 2015 but since has been taken down due to the business not existing.

Site was coded entirely from scratch, no bootstrap involved and as such the HTML/CSS isn't entirely effective. It is responsive to the extent of mobile devices through the use of media queries but this can be improved upon.
